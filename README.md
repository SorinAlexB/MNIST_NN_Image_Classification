# Neural Network for MNIST Image Classification with PyTorch

## Overview

This project is dedicated to implementing a neural network for image classification using the MNIST database. The MNIST database consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating machine learning models.

## Neural Network Basics

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's neural structure. It comprises layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Each connection has a weight, and each node has an associated activation function. The network learns by adjusting these weights during training to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.

## Techniques and Libraries

### PyTorch Framework

This project utilizes the PyTorch framework, an open-source machine learning library, for building and training the neural network. PyTorch simplifies the process of defining, training, and deploying deep learning models.

### Data Preprocessing

The MNIST dataset is preprocessed to normalize pixel values, converting them to a range suitable for training neural networks. Additionally, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture is designed with input, hidden, and output layers. The choice of activation functions, layer sizes, and optimization algorithms significantly impacts the model's performance.

### Loss Function and Optimization

For image classification tasks, a common choice is the Cross-Entropy Loss function. The optimization is performed using techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or advanced optimizers like Adam.

### Training and Evaluation

The neural network is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the testing set. Techniques like dropout and batch normalization may be applied to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.
